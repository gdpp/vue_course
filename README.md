## Vue Lifecycle Explained
The Vue.js lifecycle consists of a series of stages that a Vue component goes through from creation to destruction. Here’s a brief overview:

### Creation Phase
- **`beforeCreate`**: The component is initialized, but data observation and events are not yet set up.
- **`created`**: Data observation and events are set up. However, the component has not been mounted to the DOM yet, and the `el` property is not accessible.

### Mounting Phase
- **`beforeMount`**: The template is compiled, but the component has not been inserted into the DOM.
- **`mounted`**: The component is mounted to the DOM, meaning the template has been rendered, and you can access the DOM elements.

### Updating Phase
- **`beforeUpdate`**: Called when reactive data changes but before the DOM is patched with the new data.
- **`updated`**: Called after the DOM is updated with the new data.

### Destruction Phase
- **`beforeDestroy`**: Called just before the component is destroyed. At this point, the component is still fully functional.
- **`destroyed`**: The component is destroyed, and all watchers, child components, and event listeners are removed.

These hooks allow you to run code at specific points in a component's lifecycle.
